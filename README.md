# Insta Like Settings (Xposed Module) #

Insta Like Settings is inspired by a module request from [r/xposed](https://reddit.com/r/xposed/comments/2iwslh/request_disable_instagrams_doubletaptolike_feature/). It can intercept Instagram's double-tap-to-like feature and the heart icon click to prevent accidential likes. You can choose between a custom like dialog, no interaction at all or the default behavior (like the image).

## Features ##

* Customize Double-Tap behavior
* Customize heart icon click behavior

## Requirements ##

* Xposed Framework
* Android 4.0.3+ (including Lollipop)

## Download ##
The module is available on the [Xposed repo](http://repo.xposed.info/module/org.ollide.xposed.instagram).
